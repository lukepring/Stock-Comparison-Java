# Code of Conduct

## Professionalism & Communication
We will communicate primarily through a WhatsApp group chat that we have
set up. All team members are expected to respond to direct messages within
24 hours during the working week.<br/>
<br/>Everyone should attend the weekly stand-up meetings with our lecturer during
lab time. We will try and hold internal team meetings at least once per week to
update progress. This may be through a WhatsApp call if meeting in-person
isn’t viable.<br/>
<br/>If a member cannot attend a meeting they should inform the group at least 24
hours in advance, to avoid disruption.

## Workflow
We will use the GitHub repository “lukepring/Stock-Comparison-Java” for our coursework. Everyone should
be invited as a collaborator. Every team member should make at least one
commit per sprint.<br/>
<br/>We should not commit unfinished or broken code to the main branch. All
features should be developed on seperate branches and merged via Pull
Request after review by the team.<br/>
<br/>We will update the GitHub project KanBan board daily to reflect the status of
tasks. Tasks will be assigned based on the product backlog created in this
sprint.

## Code Quality & AI Use
We should aim to complete work before the oﬃcial submission deadline to
allow time for merging and review. Code written should be readable and
commented. We should not submit code we cannot explain or don’t fully
understand, such as code copied from AI tools.<br/>
<br/>We may use AI to help debug code, explain concepts or improve writing
quality. We shouldn’t use AI to generate complete features, ideas or
specifications. This is in-line with industry standards.

## Conflict Resolution
If a disagreement occurs, we will resolve it via a majority vote. If tied, we will
consult module teaching staﬀ.<br/>
<br/>If a member of the group doesn’t contribute or breaches this code of conduct,
we will first aim to resolve the behaviour through a team meeting or written
warning in the group chat.<br/>
<br/>If the behaviour continues, we will initiate the dismissal process outlined in the
module brief which includes evidence gathering to present to the module
delivery team, and allowing for the member to explain any mitigating
circumstances.
